- [ ] optimize global contexts; nodejs context can be made into a template that
  is instantiated for each module
- [x] require acorn & friends once and expose them to the global context
- [ ] look into https://github.com/chtefi/acorn-jsx-walk to see what kind of monkeying they're doing to get JSX traversal
- [ ] license: args
- [ ] look into minifying the JS to reduce binary size
- [ ] stream results from JS to reporter
- [x] embed v8 data blobs (natives_blob.bin, snapshot_blob.bin) into binary
- [x] parse query only once per thread
- [x] remove cpplocate
- [ ] read defaults from ~/.jsgreprc or /etc/jsgrepconfig
- [x] rename to jsq or jsgrep?
- [ ] function return type matcher
- [x] :exportOf type matcher
- [x] revisit macro expansions, perhaps generate a proper AST for the query
- [x] :function type matcher
- [x] :boolean type matcher
- [ ] JSX type matcher
- [ ] terminal type matcher (e.g. `{ foo }`)
- [x] FunctionCall(^Type)
- [ ] interpret `null` literal in function call argument types
- [ ] interpret `:void` in `:func` return type
- [ ] evaluate object literals in object literal values (e.g. `{ a: { b: :number } }`)
- [ ] consider freezing jsgrep-ql into a snapshot, see https://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/09/custom-startup-snapshots.html
- [ ] look into creating a homebrew "keg" / bottle formulae
